                <p>Everything around us is energy. Energy is pure and fluid. It is capable of transforming and taking any form</p>
            </div>
            <div class="continuation-of-the-quote"><p>Man has the ability to control energy. To do this, it is necessary to know the basic tenets of being. Hustle and bustle of modern life drives people along a written script and they forget who they really are. I Am Me is the beginning of a journey of self-discovery and awareness. The NFT project is an embodiment of the energy of light in the form of a Buddha. With this project we want to push each of us to the side of a light and conscious life. Each of us will find our own buddha. Find your Buddha!</p></div>
